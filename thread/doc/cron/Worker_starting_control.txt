[ ---Supervisor--- ]

Supervisor is process monitor for Linux. It automatically starts your console processes. For install on Ubuntu you need run command:

sudo apt-get install supervisor
Supervisor config files usually available in /etc/supervisor/conf.d. You can create any number of config files.

Config example:

[program:yii-queue-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/my_project/yii queue/listen --verbose=1 --color=0
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=www-data
numprocs=4
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/www/my_project/log/yii-queue-worker.log
In this case Supervisor must starts 4 queue/listen workers. Worker output will write into log file.

For more info about Supervisor's configure and usage see documentation.

Worker starting in daemon mode with queue/listen command supports File, Db, Redis, RabbitMQ, Beanstalk, Gearman drivers. For additional options see driver guide.

[ ---Cron--- ]

You can start worker using cron. You have to use queue/run command. It works as long as queue contains jobs.

Config example:

* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/my_project/yii queue/run
In this case cron will start the command every munute.
